The 'events' module now exposes a `listenerCount` function that
will return the number of event listeners provided a emitter and an
event name.  Create a http server with a requestListener then log
to the console the number of 'request' listeners for the server.


When you have completed your server, you can run it in the test
environment with:

  {bold}{appname} run server.js{/bold}

And once you are ready to verify it then run:

  {bold}{appname} verify server.js{/bold}
