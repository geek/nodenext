The 'http' response object now has a `statusMessage` property
that can control the HTTP status message.  Create a HTTP server
that listens on the port specified by `process.argv[2]`.
Write a status message that says "Nope" when the / path is
requested.


When you have completed your server, you can run it in the test
environment with:

  {bold}{appname} run server.js{/bold}

And once you are ready to verify it then run:

  {bold}{appname} verify server.js{/bold}
