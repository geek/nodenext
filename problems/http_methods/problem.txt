The 'http' module now exposes all supported HTTP methods.  Log
to stdout a JSON.stringify format of the available methods.


When you have completed your server, you can run it in the test
environment with:

  {bold}{appname} run server.js{/bold}

And once you are ready to verify it then run:

  {bold}{appname} verify server.js{/bold}
